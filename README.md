 Fall 24 CS505 final project. You will find code, notes, and visuals to help you use and understand the project. 

## Table of Contents 

Structure of this Repository 
- papers: contains any formal papers in tex style 

- presentation : contains slide decks valuable for understanding parts of the project 

- notebooks : contains code written in jupyter code 

- source : contains raw source code that can can be used outside of an experimental setup



## Motivations 
- The goal of this project is to experiment with musical data to build models that can hopefully generate music 

## .gitignore 
- On your local repo place all data inside of a folder named 'data'. The point of 
this is to have data is a single location we can target in the repo code. The ignore
prevents data from being pusehd to github.
