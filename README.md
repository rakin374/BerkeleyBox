## Table of Contents 

Structure of this repository:

- papers: Contains any formal papers in TeX style.
  
- presentation: Contains slide decks valuable for understanding parts of the project.
  
- notebooks: Contains code written in Jupyter notebooks.
  
- source: Contains raw source code that can be used outside of an experimental setup.

## Motivations 
The goal of this project is to experiment with musical data (MIDI files) to build models that can generate music.

## .gitignore 
On your local repository, place all data inside a folder named 'data'. The purpose of this is to have all data in a single location we can target in the repository code. The .gitignore prevents data from being pushed to GitHub.
