## Table of Contents 

Structure of this repository:
- papers: contains any formal papers in tex style 

- presentation : contains slide decks valuable for understanding parts of the project 

- notebooks : contains code written in jupyter code 

- source : contains raw source code that can can be used outside of an experimental setup

## Motivations 
- The goal of this project is to experiment with musical data (MIDI files) to build models that can generate music.

## .gitignore 
- On your local repo place all data inside of a folder named 'data'. The point of 
this is to have data is a single location we can target in the repo code. The ignore
prevents data from being pushed to GitHub.
